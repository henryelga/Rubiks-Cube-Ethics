      <h1>🔍 Final Conclusion: <br /> AI and Policy Voids</h1>

      <p>
        These two scenarios show that our current laws and ethics are not quite prepared for AI.
      </p>

      <h2>Scenario 1: The Legal Void</h2>
      <p>
        Existing laws only recognize humans as inventors. We lack a legal category for machine-led innovation.
        The law assumes only humans can invent, forcing courts to rely on legal fiction,
        which creates a <strong>Legal Policy Void</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Scenario 2: The Ethical / Philosophical Void</h2>
      <p>
        Perfect solutions like the 15-Move Solve make human effort feel unnecessary.
        Current ethics focus on efficiency but fail to protect the value of human mastery.
        We lack a framework to balance AI perfection with human purpose,
        creating an <strong>Ethical / Philosophical Policy Void</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>Our systems were built for humans and cannot handle machine-generated perfection. </p>
      <p>
        To move forward, we need new policies that acknowledge the power of AI
        while still protecting the meaning of human creativity.
      </p>
