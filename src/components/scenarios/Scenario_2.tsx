        <h2>Scenario 2: When AI Reaches Perfect Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
          In this scenario, an AI system discovers the <strong>Ultimate 15-Move Solve</strong>, a hypothetical mathematically shortest possible solution for every Rubik's Cube scramble.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the shortest known solutions require up to 20 moves (the so-called "God's Number"), so this scenario imagines a super-human AI that exceeds current human and computational capabilities
        </p>

        <p>Because this solution is a mathematical truth and required no human input,
          it raises an ethical and philosophical question:</p>

        <blockquote className="policy-quote">
          If a perfect solution exists, what is the point of human effort, skill, and mastery?
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Why This Creates a Ethical / Philosophical Problem</h2>

        <p>
          Most ethical frameworks assume that more efficiency and knowledge are always better. However, they rarely consider the social and personal cost of AI perfection. When a machine makes a human skill obsolete, it creates an <strong>Ethical Void</strong>, a gap where the value of our struggle, learning, and discipline begins to disappear.

        <h2>Analysis: Conflicting Viewpoints</h2>

        <h3>The Utilitarian Perspective (Outcome and Efficiency)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Principle:</strong> Actions are right if they maximize the greatest benefit for the most people. (Mill, 1863)</li>
          <li><strong>The View:</strong> The AI solution is objectively better and should be shared as public knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>The Dilemma:</strong> If a perfect answer is always available, it may destroy the motivation to learn.
            In the long run, absolute efficiency might actually decrease human well-being by removing the joy of achievement. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Virtue Ethics (Effort and Purpose)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Principle:</strong> The value of an activity lies in the character and skill you build while doing it. (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics)</li>
          <li><strong>The View:</strong> Solving the Rubik's Cube builds patience, spatial reasoning, and discipline.</li>
          <li><strong>The Risk:</strong> AI perfection replaces struggle with memorization, a shortcut.
            If we prioritize the machine's result over the human's journey, we diminish the purpose of human mastery</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>The Breakdown</h2>
        <p>
          Our ethical systems currently lack the tools to manage "super-human disruptive knowledge."
        </p>
        <p>
          We generally welcome technology that enhances human ability. We are unprepared for technology that replaces human ability entirely. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Analogy:</strong> Allowing an AI to compete in human sports would destroy the value of the game. 
          This is because the meaning of sports and puzzles comes from human limits. 
          If we remove the limit, we risk removing the meaning.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion: What This Scenario Shows</h2>
        <p>
          The real failure is not that AI can achieve perfection, but that our ethical 
          systems cannot protect the value of human effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scenario 2 demonstrates that we need new policies to manage perfect knowledge, 
          ensuring that we balance machine efficiency with the preservation of human purpose.

      <section>
        <h2>My Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This scenario shows that while an AI can provide a perfect 15-move algorithm, 
          it cannot replace the experience of solving it ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must decide if progress is defined by the AI's perfect results, 
          or if the human effort to learn is what truly gives the puzzle meaning.
