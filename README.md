# Solving the Rubik's Cube in the Age of AI 
*Exploring the gap between AI perfection and human rules.*

## 🎯 Overview
This project examines how **Machine Perfection** creates "Policy Voids", gaps where current laws and ethics fail to address super-human AI performance. <br/>
Using the Rubik’s Cube as a case study, it explores the tension between technical optimization and human values.

## 🚀 Key Scenarios
- **Scenario 01: The Legal Void** <br/>
    Focuses on Intellectual Property. If AI creates a "perfect" algorithm, who owns the patent?
- **Scenario 02: The Ethical Void** <br/>
    Focuses on Human Purpose. Does machine efficiency destroy the value of human mastery?

## ⚖️ Conclusion
The project concludes that we must bridge the policy void, to recognize AI's unique capabilities while protecting human effort.
